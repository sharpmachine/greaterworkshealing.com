		<description><![CDATA[Praise the Lord!!! This is right on! Until we get a revelation of who we are, we can never do the works that Jesus did. If we see ourselves any less than who Daddy said we were, we will always fall short of our calling and destiny. 
  What can you add to the cross ?!!!! What can you add to the finished work of His shed blood who once and for all eradicated and destroyed the handwriting on the wall? The spirit of performance must be squashed in our lives. It was not by works that you were saved and it is not by works that you can receive anything else from Daddy. 
  You can stand before both God and satan and declare with all good conscience, &quot; you have found nothing in me&quot;, I am just as clean and whole and holy as Jesus. Thanks be to God for His mighty blood.]]></description>
