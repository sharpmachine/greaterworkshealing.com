		<description><![CDATA[Hey dude, this is good but I&#039;m getting some questions regarding people who claim to be Christians but they spend Monday through Saturday womanizing, boozing, smoking weed and selling drugs and then spends Sunday at church playing in the worship band.  So what about these peeps.  Can you write an article from that perspective?]]></description>

The truth of what you have said brings freedom and liberty and far from causing people to sin more as some have suggested, will cause people to want to sin less as the revelation of what Jesus accomplished on the cross  becomes a reality in their hearts.]]></description>
