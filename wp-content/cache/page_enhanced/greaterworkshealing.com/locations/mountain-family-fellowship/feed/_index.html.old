		<description><![CDATA[Dear Pastor Paul,
Pastor Dokken suggested that I contact you.  I couldn&#039;t find a phone number so decided to try this avenue.  I am a minister in Oregon.  I pastored two Assembly of God churches over a period of 21 years.  For the past 8 years we have been travelling all over the country ministering in hundreds of churches.  Our main focus of ministry has been on the subject of prayer and intimacy with Christ.  We also have a strong emphasis on the Holy Spirit.  I would love to talk with you more about this.  Please call me at 503.881.9661.  We would love the opportunity to share with your church.   We travel with a 5th wheel so have our own lodging accomodations.   Our website has some information about our ministry and includes some references and testimonials about our ministry.  God bless your ministry there in Helena.
