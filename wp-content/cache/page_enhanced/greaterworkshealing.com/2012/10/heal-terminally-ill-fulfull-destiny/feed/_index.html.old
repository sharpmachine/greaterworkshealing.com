		<description><![CDATA[Praise the Lord for what He is doing through you both as you step out in obedience to the call of God to heal the sick and set the captives free. Greater is He that is in you , to do the &#039; greater works &#039;
May the Lortd strengthen you and provide for all your needs  as you do His work and equip others to do the same !
Galatians 6:9
 &quot;And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.&quot;]]></description>
