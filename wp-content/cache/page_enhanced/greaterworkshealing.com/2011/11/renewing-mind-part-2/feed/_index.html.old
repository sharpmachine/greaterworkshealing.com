		<description><![CDATA[Amen brother, preach it! We have made our God way to small and have viewed ourselves as way to powerless. That is due to us not knowing our God nor knowing who we are in our God. Without God we can do absolutely nothing. With our God, there is nothing we cannot do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, do take every thought captive. If it is not rooted in victory, it only leads the other way. Too often we start from a place of doubt not victory: &quot;Jesus please heal...please save...please free...&quot;. JESUS already took care of that, long ago. Stand in the victory and command the enemy be gone and celebrate the victory! Stop using words that satan and co. use as mottos: if, when,maybe, please future tense instead of now, make it - again future tense instead of now, but. Get out of dreaming and use the mimd of Christ we have! Why would God give us less tools to use than satan? That is where we put ourselves when we beg Jesus for things. Satan knows it isaccomplished but wants to see us beg because then we buy into not using our heitage and tools of righteous love that overcomes all things. Satan wants us to struggle in religious swamps, forms of how to do things, instead of standing in ourMind of Christ and taking victory right away. &quot;Stand and deliver&quot;. As a dear pastor i know says &quot;I want satqn to know exactly who i am because i intend to plant myself right outside the gatees of hell and save every last soul i can because Jesus has already done that for them, and i want them to see their passport is stamped healed, saved, delivered, brother and sister of Christ - not &quot;he doesn&#039;t care, i am too sinful, ...&quot; NOT ON MY WATCH!]]></description>
