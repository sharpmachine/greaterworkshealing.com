		<description><![CDATA[Two years ago God gave a Word of Prophecy to us in Cheyenne WY that He was going to bring revival throughout America.  This fire of revival would begin in Alabama, the first state listed alphabetically, and also in Wyoming, the last state alphabetically listed.  As the fire of His Holiness and Presence burned from these two states outward beyond their borders, revival would be spread from the first and the last states to touch every state of this country with His Holiness and Fire.  
What you have shared is an encouragement to all of us in Wyoming to believe that He will bring His Word to pass and that we will experience a true revival of Holiness and Fire not only in our state but also in our nation!]]></description>
