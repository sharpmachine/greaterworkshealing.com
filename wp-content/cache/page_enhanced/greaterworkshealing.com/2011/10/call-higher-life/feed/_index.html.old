		<description><![CDATA[OH, its so our hearts to rise up above status quo Christianity. Powerless Christianity will not change peoples lives, let alone change the culture of nations to Kingdom Culture. How else are we to demonstrate Daddy&#039;s love to a lost, poor, blind, naked and needy world, if we do not demonstrate it like Jesus did, in absolute unfettered power. Power that breaks the chains of every type of bondage and eradicates every type of disease, even destroying and overcoming literal death. 
  An angel came to John G. Lake and said to him, &quot; this is Pentecost as God gave it through the heart of Jesus. Strive for this, contend for this, Teach the people to pray for this. For this ALONE, ( emphasis mine ), will meet the necessity of the human heart and have the power to overcome the forces of darkness. What was this angel saying? He was declaring, that Pentecost, ( being truly baptized in Holy Spirit), and this alone, will destroy all bondage in the human heart, and overcome the dark veil over peoples minds, wills and emotions, in and out of the church. Only this power will heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, ( incurable diseases ), cast out demons, heal the broken hearted, open blind eyes, open deaf ears, release the captives, deliver the oppressed, bruised, crushed and broken down. Our God reigns! Mark Kuntz]]></description>
