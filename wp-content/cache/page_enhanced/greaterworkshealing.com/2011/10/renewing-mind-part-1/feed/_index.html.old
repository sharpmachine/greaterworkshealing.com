		<description><![CDATA[Oh yea, we give way too much focus on the enemy, our personal problems and the cares of this world, which choke out the fruit in our lives. What we focus on , we empower. That is why we are admonished in His Word to keep our eyes fixed, stayed, focused and gazed upon Jesus, and His marvelous cross. 
  There is now way we can fail, because Love never fails. Never give in, never give up and never cast away your confidence in Jesus Christ. He is not a man, that He should lie.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rightfully said Marc! It is not about us and never will be. It is about Jesus pure and simple. Until we stop spinning our wheels dualing with satan and co.,which keeps us busy in us and ignoring Jesus, until we recognize Jesus has taken care of this already, we will never see the deliverance, healing, salvations we are looking for. It is  not about us. &quot;Stand and deliver&quot;.   &quot;As I  AM, so too YOU ARE&quot;. Amen and amen.]]></description>
