		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing Mark, yes we need to appropriate the promises that are &#039; Yes and amen&#039; to us .. this challenges me once again today to rise up in faith ...Intimacy with the Father is a true key .This is so true that hurts and wounds in our life  create a veil from us seeing who we truly are in Christ! The Father is speaking to me daily about putting my trust only in Him.. good word thanks !]]></description>
