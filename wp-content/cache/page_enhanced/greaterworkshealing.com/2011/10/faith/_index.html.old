						<p>I would like to talk to you today about the active role of faith in securing the promises of God. The Word says that</p>
<blockquote><p>“…without faith, it is impossible to please and be satisfactory to Him. For whoever would come near to God must (necessarily) believe that God exists and that He is the rewarder of those who earnestly and diligently seek Him out.”</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:6 (Amp.)</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that there is a lot of stigma and condemnation over the use of faith, and many are afraid to address the church’s lack of faith head on, because it can lead to guilt and shame. Please hear my heart on this subject: my desire is not to put anyone into bondage, but to bring truth that will set us free to be who God created us to be. Faith is a sensitive subject because every one of us has been challenged when we do not receive what we have asked for. Is it due to lack of faith or is it that we just need to press through until we receive our victory? Is it due to another reason, perhaps sin or an ungodly mindset that we don’t even know we have? These are real issues that we must explore in love.</p>
<p>I never want to get into questioning anyone’s personal faith, but the fact remains that we in the Body of Christ do not receive many of Daddy’s promises due to lack of faith on our part. First of all, I want to say that we are all in various stages in our walk with God, walking in various levels of maturity and faith as we pursue our relationship with Him. I think we should honestly realize where we are at, without feeling any sort of condemnation for it. After all, we do not attempt to put guilt and shame on a baby for trying to crawl or attempting to walk. It is a normal process in our natural life to grow in our bodies until we are fully mature.</p>
<p>In the same way we are in various stages of faith and maturity in our spiritual growth. The enemy tries very hard to challenge our faith level because he knows if we take the bait we will be defeated and receive nothing. That is what the enemy attempted to do with Jesus while He was in the wilderness (Luke 4). Jesus never took the bait but stood strong in the Word of God. He knew who He was. None of us are walking in all the available faith that there is, but we can continue to do the things that will help us continue to grow and mature until we fly, as the sons of God.</p>
<p>I think it is more important to look at where we are at, individually and corporately, and to admit that we fall short, ask God for His grace, and learn how we can walk in an ever-increasing faith and power to overcome ALL the works of the devil. I find it interesting that one minute Jesus seems to be congratulating Peter that he has the revelation of who Jesus is (Matthew 16:17), and in the next minute He is rebuking Peter for thinking like a man, saying, “Get behind Me, satan!” (Matthew 16:23).</p>
<p>We cannot ignore the truth that Jesus challenged the faith of the disciples (Matthew 8:26), and taught them to walk in faith (Mark 11:22-26). He mentioned many times that it was the person’s faith that healed them (Matthew 9:20-22; 9:27-38), and marveled at the centurion’s faith (Matthew 8:5-13), and even seemed to change his mind with the Canaanite woman (Matthew 15:22-28), saying, “Great is your faith!” So how do we increase our faith?</p>
<p>I think the key in receiving everything from the Lord that we need to walk in complete victory as overcomers, comes from spending intimate time with Him. I feel the number one reason we do not walk in faith is our lack of intimacy with our God. There seems to be a great identity crisis in the church. We don’t really know who we are as true sons and daughters of the living God. I see this issue wherever we go. We have so many ungodly mindsets due to a myriad of hurts and wounds throughout life that they veil us from seeing who we really are. We can quote the scriptures, but the Word is not a reality in our hearts. This is directly related to our level of maturity in faith.</p>
<p>True maturity, faith, and peace can come only to those who are in active fellowship with God. There are no shortcuts and faith cannot be mustered up through our will because it is spiritual. It is time for the Body of Christ to begin to “walk by faith, by walking in the Spirit.” Romans chapter 8 teaches clearly that to walk in victory we must walk in the Spirit at all times. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God (Romans 8:14). I believe with all my heart that when you begin to see who you really are, as a result of spending intimate time with God, you will never again question God’s love for you, and your faith will grow, knowing with all certainty that God is not a man that He should lie, and that He will do what He said He would do. He can be trusted.</p>
<p>It is time for a great paradigm shift in our mindsets. We must begin to walk in the Spirit at all times in all things. I love the Amplified Bible because it expounds on the original Greek and Hebrew meanings of the original scriptures. Romans 8:6 says, “Now the mind of the flesh, [which is sense and reason], without the Holy Spirit, is death, death that comprises all the miseries arising from sin, both here and hereafter. But the mind of the Holy Spirit is life and soul peace, both now and forever. The majority of the church thinks with (sense and reason) when they are in trouble. We put more faith in doctors, banks, governments and scientists than we do in the Word of God. We think and act with the natural way of thinking, which is ok, but there is a much better and higher way, that is perfect. It is like living on the wrong side of the Jordan. Instead of the best, living in the promised land, we choose to stay and live on the other side of the river, in sense and reason land.</p>
<p>The Lord recently showed me another revelation of His statement to Peter in the garden of Gethsemane when He stated, “For all who draw or live by the sword, will die by the sword (Matthew 26:52). In Psalm 118:9, it says it is better to put your trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes. Psalm 20:7 says, “Some trust in and boast of chariots and some of horses, but we will trust in and boast of the name of the Lord our God.” He showed me that those who put their faith and trust in earthly ways, and in earthly ways of doing business, those who live by the world’s way, the natural way, will die by the world’s way, the natural way. Saints of God, there is the kingdom of this world and there is the Kingdom of God, and they are in direct opposition to one another. The laws of the Kingdom of God are not the same as our natural earthly laws, for they are Spirit and they are Life. Only in the Kingdom of God, when we die, we can truly live.</p>
<p>Matthew 6:33 says, “But seek, aim at and strive after, first of all His Kingdom and His righteousness, His way of doing and being right, and then all these things taken together will be given you besides.” If you back up to Matthew 6:21, Jesus declares that, “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” Beginning in Matthew 6:24, we have Jesus teaching his disciples to “not be anxious nor worry about your life, what you will eat or drink,” etc., and rebuking them for their lack of faith. What do we spend the majority of our life doing? Where do we spend the most of our time? Where is our treasure? Is it in His Kingdom or in the natural world?</p>
<p>Again, no condemnation here. My heart is to see the Body grow up and manifest Gods pure love to the lost and dying world, rising up in a faith, that says, all things are possible with our God!!! When we seek His face with all of our heart, we will find Him. We will reflect His love, His heart and His power and out of that direct relationship we will grow to become just like Jesus in every way. All things are possible to those who believe (Mark 9:23). So please, let us not cast away our confidence (Hebrews 10:35). Seek Him with all of our hearts, and we will find Him. Then go!! Pray for as many as you can, using the gifts Daddy has given you.</p>
<p>2nd Timothy 1:6 tells us to stir up the gifts, activate them in your life, by using them. Timothy received the gift from Paul by the laying on of hands. Then Paul instructed him to stir them up. If it came from the laying on of hands it must be a gift from the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>We are told to desire earnestly the best gifts. 1st Corinthians 12:31 says “…but earnestly desire and zealously cultivate the greatest and best gifts…”</p>
